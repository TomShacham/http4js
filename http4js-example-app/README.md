## http4js example app

This app gives you an idea of how you would use [http4js](https://github.com/TomShacham/http4js).

We do basic database operations. We have two simple approval tests.
We serve a few endpoints: some `get` and a `post` with a form.  

#### To run

```typescript
yarn 
yarn test
```
